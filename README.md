# bin2ascii

A simple script for Python 3.4 that can convert binary to ascii, and ascii to
binary. Simply run `python3 converter.py` to get started.


# Setup

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/huberf/bin2ascii`
2. Enter directory via `cd bin2ascii/`
3. To start script `python3 converter.py`
4. For access system wide place `bin2ascii` file in your executable path, along
   with the `converter.py` file. You can now use the tool without being in the
   individual directory by typing `bin2ascii`.

# Background

I saw some binary text someone had posted and wanted to quickly write a script
in around a minute to handle the conversion, so I created this quick and simple
utility.
